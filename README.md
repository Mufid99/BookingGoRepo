# BookingGoRepo

## Part 1:
The IDE I used to make the program was intellij.
### To set it up do the following:

* clone the repository
* set the sdk
* navigate to file -> project structure -> Modules
* set the out folder as excluded, src as sources and test as tests
* now navigate from modules to project and set the project compiler output directory to be the out folder

### Running part 1:

* run the main method in the main class
* to run the simple part of part 1 where only dave's cars are used input 1 into the console
* to run the complete version of part 1 input 2 into the console
